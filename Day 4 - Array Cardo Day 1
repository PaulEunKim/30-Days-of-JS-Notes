//you can make a nodelist into an array by wrapping code around Array.from();

//you can also do this by wrapping code in [...//code here]

//you can user querySelector or querySelectorAll on variables, not just document

//you can run code in the console, then see what variables by entering the variable name and pressing enter

//you can format your functions like this

const de = links
                .map(link => link.textContent) //do not add an extra semicolon here
                .filter(streetName => streetName.includes('de'));

const alpha = people.sort(function(lastOne, nextOne){
      const [last,first] = lastOne.split(', ')
      
//method to separate names that have commas, also initialization of array

//when using... (data being an array of strings)

    const transporation = data.reduce(function(obj, item){

// function(obj, item) will take two items iteratively.
