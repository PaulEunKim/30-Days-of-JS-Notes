//you can make a nodelist into an array by wrapping code around Array.from();

//you can also do this by wrapping code in [...//code here]

//you can user querySelector or querySelectorAll on variables, not just document

//you can run code in the console, then see what variables by entering the variable name and pressing enter

//you can format your functions like this

const de = links
                .map(link => link.textContent) //do not add an extra semicolon here
                .filter(streetName => streetName.includes('de'));
